I love small details in web design. Little geometric shapes, lines and scribbles in the background or layered through the content; it's a nice way to add visual flair without taking up space for content.<br>
Another thing I love are animations when scrolling and navigating through a page. Subtle animations can draw the user's attention, provide visual clues and can be used for visual storytelling.

Adding more complexity to your website normally comes at a cost: through a combination of more nodes in the HTML document, advanced CSS features and usually a bunch of JavaScript, the page will quickly become bloated, slow and choppy. Users with lower-end hardware will be the first to notice your website being sluggish, subsequently leading to less interactivity and page views.

## 1. Reducing page size

## 2. Accelerated animations and transitions

## 3. Writing efficient JavaScript

## 4. Optimizing with DevTools
