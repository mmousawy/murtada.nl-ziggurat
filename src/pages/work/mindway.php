        <h3>Case</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content-row__text">
        <p>eHealth@Mind was the previous name for the initiative branch of a large healthcare organization. The initiative focused on delivering the best mental he therapy through digital communication mediums.</p>
        <p>The initiative was still young, and was attempting to get a foothold in the eHealth market. So our web team was tasked to re-imagine and redesign the brand. The initiative's main qualities needed to be highlighted and described for the target audience. But what are these qualities and who is the target audience?</p>
        <p>Another question was: what could make the new website competitive? We suggested an in-depth marketing and target audience research to establish the right strategic posture for the rebrand.</p>
        <p>With the web and marketing team, we set out to research, analyze, ideate, design and develop the new brand into a thought out campaign and website.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="content-row__text">
        <p>By spending time with the marketing team to actually research the market, the competitors and the target audience, our team got insights into what market position eHealth@Mind was in. The goal of eHealth@Mind was to gain a certain amount of clients by the end of the year. The specifics of this goal were sorted out by our collective efforts to make the goal SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-oriented.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Our next step was to pinpoint our target audience and ask relevant and specific questions in order to be able to settle on many appearance and attitude aspects of the organization. This was done because we wanted to be sure the target audience trusts the company, since they're going to have to entrust their personal information (during therapy sessions) to utilize their services. So creating an image that is trustworthy was of high priority.<br>
        Of course we could have filled in a lot of questions that we had ourselves, but we wanted to be sure to have the target audience stand behind our choices as well.</p>

        <p>Before the design page, we started out by first inventorying all the relevant information and create clear sections and pages for them respectively. Our idea was to work content-first: produce a qualitative website by actually creating user journeys and user flows in order to create an overview of all the interactions and steps we might've missed. This resulted in a few extensive flow diagrams and a bunch of sketches and wireframes. From these steps we developed UX journey maps to delve into the particularly difficult journey steps.</p>

        <p>Our design needed to reflect our previous findings. This meant that for every design decision we referred to our marketing goals, flows and personas to make sure the design would be helping towards achieving the established goals.</p>
        <p>Development consisted mainly of wrestling with a CMS (WordPress) to hold and present the content of the pages. The translation of the visual design to an actual functional website was straight-forward. We worked with SCSS variables and partials to make it easy to change modules in the website. We created modules with PHP templates and adhered to a strict BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) approach for naming modules in the website.</p>

        <h4>Iterability in sprints</h4>
        <p>As a last note, I wanted to highlight the project management methodology we applied for Mindway. Since our project scope and end-results were being assessed during the first part of the project, we didn't want to be held back by other parts of the project. To work more efficiently we chose to work in sprints of a single week, where we planned new features and evaluated work that was done.<br>
        Along with the weekly stand-up we had a weekly marketing meeting to check if our development was on track with the marketing standpoints and the end-goals are still being achieved.</p>
        <p>All the features were developed in such a way that big decisions could be reverted and the risk of the project failing would be practically non-existent.</p>

        <p>Deploying the last iteration of the project and making the announcement was a special moment. A project with a continuous process that almost took a year culminated in a beautiful website.</p>
        <p>eHealth@Mind's practitioners and management team worked alongside us to create something they could be proud of. A new face and a new name meant new opportunities.</p>
        <p>Mindway is now the face of a team of psychologists and therapists who are excited to show off what their company can deliver on: being together on the road to recovery.</p>
